# SHA-256

Implementation of the SHA256 hash algorithm as defined in FIPS 180-4, see
https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf.

Tests the SHA256 hash algorithm as defined in FIPS 180-4, using the testing
specification in https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/Cryptographic-Standards-and-Guidelines/documents/examples/SHA256.pdf.

On a guide on how to build the SHA-256 algorithm from scratch, see
